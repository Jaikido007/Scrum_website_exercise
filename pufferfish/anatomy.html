        Pufferfish breath like normal fish - taking water in through the mouth and absorbing oxygen dissolved in the water and expel carbon dioxide rich water through their gills.

        Intimidating posture: These fish might look adorable when theyâ€™re puffed up, but the truth is that this trait is an intimidating survival mechanism. Few predators will stick around to eat a fish that has suddenly doubled in visual size.

        Poison spikes: One of the adaptations that helps the pufferfish survive is the ability to produce a poison known as tetraodotoxin. This toxin is secreted across their body, making puffers dangerous to touch and even more dangerous to consume.

        <br>
        Romantic disposition: Despite their violent attitude towards humans and other predators, pufferfish are actually quite attached to their mates. The male usually helps the female lay her eggs by guiding her through the water and rubbing her side as she gives birth.
