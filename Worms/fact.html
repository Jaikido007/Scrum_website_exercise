    <h3>What is a worm?</h3>
    <div class="facts"></div>
        <ul>
            <p>An earthworm consists of a digestive tube housed within a thick cylindrical muscular tube that forms the body. The body is divided into segments, and furrows on the surface of the body mark the division between each segment. The first segment encloses the mouth, and has a fleshy, muscular lobe on the top.</p>
            <h3>Do worms feel pain?</h3>
            <p>A team of Swedish researchers have uncovered evidence that worms do indeed feel pain, and that worms have developed a chemical system similar to that of human beings to protect themselves from it.</p>
            <h3>How do worms have babies?</h3>
            <p>Earthworms are hermaphrodite organisms, meaning that each earthworm has both male and female reproduction organs. ... Because both earthworms are performing the function of both a male and female during reproduction, they are known as simultaneous hermaphrodites.</p>
