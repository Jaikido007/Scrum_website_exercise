        <h2>Facts about Hedgehogs</h2>
        <p>




            After cats, hedgehogs might be the internet's favorite animal. But how much do you know about these spiky mammals—other than how cute they look when getting a bath?

            <b>1. A GROUP OF HEDGEHOGS IS CALLED AN "ARRAY."</b>

            But it doesn't come up much, since hedgehogs are solitary creatures who usually come together only to mate.

            The hedgie has gained some popularity as a pet—but some cities and states still qualify them as wild animals, which are not allowed to be kept domestically. These include Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and New York City and Washington, D.C. In some areas, like Maine, you need permits in order to own one.

            <b>3. A HEDGEHOG HAS BETWEEN 5000 AND 7000 QUILLS.</b>

            Muscles along the animal's back can raise and lower the quills to respond to threatening situations.
            
            <br><br>
            
            <b>4. THERE ARE 17 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF HEDGEHOG, NONE OF WHICH ARE NATIVE TO AMERICA.</b>

            Australia also has no indigenous hedgehogs; the hedgies in New Zealand were introduced by humans.
